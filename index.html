    <h2>Who are these cool dudes?</h2></center>
  <p align="justify"> The crested gecko is a species of gecko from New Caledonia (east of Australia) that was thought to be extinct until recently. Crested geckos do not have eyelids and use their tongues to keep each eye moist.They appear in a bunch of different shades of yellow and orange. They eat fruits, veggies and some insects and can lose their tail if frightened.</p>
